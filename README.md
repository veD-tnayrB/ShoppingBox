# What is ShoppingGo?
ShoppingGO is a project carried out by Bryant Caballero that serve as a practice to improve yours skills in HTML, CSS, JS.

## Why ShoppingGo?
It's just a name I came up with as I slept the same day I started planning the project.

## Is it finished?
At the moment yes, I finish practicing manipulating the DOM with JavaScript Vanilla, I learned many things in the process and I liked it so much that I will surely continue to do it

## What did you learn in the process?
Learned about manipulating child elements with vanilla CSS using :nth-child()

`#element:nth-child(2) {
    background: red;
}`

In this case if #element is a container the red color will be applied to the background of the child element with value 2, here it does not work like arrays, here it starts from 1

I also learned everything I know about the DOM, learned about the fragment the cloneNode() method, reforce knowledge about how array functions work, learned about events, etc, etc, etc.

### This is the end of the project?
Surely if it is, maybe I should solve a bug later but in theory this is the end, at least clear that I can think of some other function that I can add that goes with the theme of the page but I am not sure
